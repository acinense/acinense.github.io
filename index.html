                            <p>In our country, democracy plays a huge role in ensuring that our administration functions with little troubles and the people's involvement and voices are considered with the way the government operates. Democracy has always been a desire for our country and its citizens even as we reminisce back to centuries of Philippine history, so why it is that the concept of democracy and its effectivity has been altered from something that was a reality, into a subject that begins to blur?</p>
