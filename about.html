                    <p>I am a Grade 9 scholar studying in Philippine Science High School, Central Luzon Campus. I am 14 years old, living in the province of Pangasinan in Alaminos City. I like to describe myself as intrigued when it comes to topics about society.</p>
                    <p>I am a Grade 9 scholar who is concerned about social issues that are encountered in our country as well as the world. As a scholar, I open my mind up and make myself aware of the issues and conflicts happening in our society, and I generally have some insights regarding these. I am more than willing to extend this mindset towards others to promote involvement and awareness when necessary for our country.</p>
                    <p> I was inspired to write about democracy because of the situation the Philippines is slowly plummeting to. It is not a pretty sight to see. I made this as my topic in hopes that those who would read it may realize the significance of their part as citizens in choosing our leaders, and that our government is more accountable for many faults in our system than we know. It is truly evident that our People's Power may be dying, or forced to die down, and it should be relived, just as powerful as it was during the People's Power Revolution in 1986.</p>
                    <p>For me, the Philippines desire for democracy is very beneficial for our country. However, if we keep exercising it the wrong way, our country will likely end up in shambles.</p>
